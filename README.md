# C-Programming-Projects
Welcome to my C Programming Projects repository! This collection contains a variety of console-based programs implemented in C, each designed to explore and demonstrate core concepts in programming. Projects range from interactive games to a calculator, focusing on user input, control structures, functions, and algorithms.

Projects
1. Calculator : 
A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations. The user can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers. Additionally, the program includes a loop allowing the user to perform consecutive calculations until they choose to exit.

Features: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Usage: The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /). It displays the result and asks if the user wants to perform another calculation.

2. Guess the Number Game : 
A guessing game where the computer generates a random number within a range, and the user tries to guess it. Hints are provided based on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping guide the player toward the correct answer.

Features: Difficulty levels (Easy, Moderate, Hard) with different ranges, hint system
Usage: The game asks the user to select a difficulty level and then guess the number. It provides hints until the user guesses correctly and displays the number of attempts.

3. Stone-Paper-Scissors Game : 
An interactive Stone-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer. The computer makes a random choice, and you input your choice to see who wins.

Features: Random choice generation for the computer, win/loss/draw results
Usage: The game prompts the user to choose 'S' (Stone), 'P' (Paper), or 'X' (Scissors). It then compares the choices and displays the result, asking if the user wants to play again.

Future Plans
I plan to continue adding more C projects to this repository. Feel free to check back for updates, and suggestions are always welcome!
